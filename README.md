## Description

In this assignment, I was tasked into creating a multiple choice timed quiz using coding related questions. The quiz runs in the browser and was built using DOM manipulation via JavaScript. The quiz features a countdown timer that penalized you if you answerd a question incorrectly and a high scores page where the user would enter their intials for completing the quiz before the timer runs out.
